EXPERIENCE
Hi-Tec Enterprises, Oxnarnd — General Management
Feb 2016 - PRESENT
Accounting
Logistics
Customer Service
I transitioned the company’s records from an outdated platform to Quickbooks, making all information more accessible and organized. That transition saved time in everyone's routine, allowing the company for a more concise setup.  
Qualitec Inc., Sao Paulo - Brazil — Industrial Chemist

Industrial Processes Supervisor
Customer Service Advisor
Supply Chain Compliance Management
ISO 9001 Maintenance
Managing production, quality control, suppliers and customers. I was able to increase the company's profit by reevaluating the  costs of the process and dismissing customers that were requesting prices under the established margin. That also decreased hours of productition reducing machinery use and over-hour payments.  
TECHNICAL PROJECTS

Project 3 (not done yet)

My Model was able to explain 96% of the variation of the predictions, with a 21% rate of error for “False Negatives”
Preparing and Cleaning Data, EDA (exploratory data analysis), Modeling - 3 models were applied, Random Forest, KNN and Lgbm - LGBM had the best results and it was the model chosen to be used.
Cervical Cancer Prediction

This Project was designed to predict Cervical Cancer based on patient's behavior, Age and other medical history, my model was able to explain 96% of the variation of the predictions, with a 21% rate of error for “False Negatives”
Data was prepared and cleaned, EDA (exploratory data analysis) was done and interesting trends were observed, all confirmed by other studies published on cancer.gov. Modeling - 3 models were applied, Random Forest, KNN and Lgbm - LGBM had the best results and it was the model chosen to be used.
Sales Prediction Model

This Project was created to evaluate if the data collected would be useful for predicting prices, unfortunately the data had very low correlation or relevance to the prediction.
Data was prepared, EDA (exploratory data analysis) was done, Modeling - 3 models were applied, Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest, Random Forest had the best results but not relevant to the prediction.
