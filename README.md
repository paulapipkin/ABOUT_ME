### TECHNICAL PROJECTS

**Project 3 (in progress)**  _[link](https://github.com/paulapipkin/Project_3_IMDB)_

Evaluating factors that are relevant for the revenue of a movie. This dataset collects most relevant information for movies released between 2012 and 2021. The features cover information like budget, revenue, ratings, certification and so on.Data was collected through API calls. Predictive model still in progress.

**Cervical Cancer Prediction** _[link](https://github.com/paulapipkin/Cervical_Cancer_Risk-Factor)_

This Project was designed to predict Cervical Cancer based on patient's behavior, Age and other medical history, my model was able to explain 96% of the variation of the predictions, with a 21% rate of error for “False Negatives”

Data was prepared and cleaned, EDA (exploratory data analysis) was done and interesting trends were observed, all confirmed by other studies published on cancer.gov. Modeling - 3 models were applied, Random Forest, KNN and Lgbm - LGBM had the best results and it was the model chosen to be used.

**Sales Prediction Model** _[link](https://github.com/paulapipkin/sales_predictions)_

This Project was created to evaluate if the data collected would be useful for predicting prices, unfortunately the data had very low correlation or relevance to the prediction.

Data was prepared, EDA (exploratory data analysis) was done, Modeling - 3 models were applied, Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest, Random Forest had the best results but not relevant to the prediction.

### EDUCATION

**UDACITY** - AWS Machine Learning Engineer
October 2022 - February 2023

The goal of the AWS Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) Nanodegree program is to equip software developers/data scientists with the data science and machine learning skills required to build and deploy machine learning models in production using Amazon SageMaker. This program will focus on the latest best practices
and capabilities that are enabled by Amazon SageMaker, including new model design/deployment features and case studies in which they can be applied to.

**Faculdade Oswaldo Cruz**, São Paulo, Brazil - Postgraduate Course Industrial Processes
June 2012 - July 2014

**Universidade Estadual de Maringá**, Paraná, Brazil - B.S. Chemistry
February 2004 - December 2008

### EXPERIENCE

**Hi-Tec Enterprises**, Oxnard, CA — General Management
Feb 2016 - PRESENT

* Accounting
* Logistics
* Customer Service

I transitioned the company’s records from an outdated platform to Quickbooks, making all information more accessible and organized. That transition saved time in everyone's routine, allowing the company for a more concise setup. 

**Qualitec Inc.**, Sao Paulo - Brazil — Industrial Chemist
2008 - 2014

* Industrial Processes Supervisor
* Customer Service Advisor
* Supply Chain Compliance Management
* ISO 9001 Maintenance

Managing production, quality control, suppliers and customers. I was able to increase the company's profit by reevaluating the  costs of the process and dismissing customers that were requesting prices under the established margin. That also decreased hours of productition reducing machinery use and over-hour payments.
